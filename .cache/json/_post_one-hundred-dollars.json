I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. <strong>I love you, buddy!</strong> <em>Shut up and take my money!</em> Fry, we have a crate to deliver.</p>\r\n<h2>Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</h2>\r\n<p>What kind of a father would I be if I said no? You&#8217;ve killed me! Oh, you&#8217;ve killed me! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Pansy. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Leela&#8217;s gonna kill me.</li>\r\n<li>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I&#8217;d die like this. But I always really hoped.</li>\r\n<li>Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Good man. Nixon&#8217;s pro-war and pro-family.</h3>\r\n<p>Ask her how her day was. Then we&#8217;ll go with that data file! I&#8217;m Santa Claus! Isn&#8217;t it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Soothe us with sweet lies.</li>\r\n<li>You don&#8217;t know how to do any of those.</li>\r\n<li>What are their names?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Stop! Don&#8217;t shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Well, then good news! It&#8217;s a suppository. Bender, we&#8217;re trying our best. No argument here. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I&#8217;d die like this. But I always really hoped.</p>\r\n<p>You guys go on without me! I&#8217;m going to go… look for more stuff to steal! OK, this has gotta stop. I&#8217;m going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. It doesn&#8217;t look so shiny to me.</p>\r\n<p>Soothe us with sweet lies. So I really am important? How I feel when I&#8217;m drunk is correct? You&#8217;re going to do his laundry? Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as &#8220;the brig&#8221;.</p>\r\n<p>Now Fry, it&#8217;s been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? I&#8217;m a thing. Check it out, y&#8217;all. Everyone who was invited is here. We&#8217;re also Santa Claus!</p>\r\n<p>Moving along… You lived before you met me?! I don&#8217;t want to be rescued. Hey, tell me something. You&#8217;ve got all this money. How come you always dress like you&#8217;re doing your laundry? I&#8217;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s toe-tappingly tragic! It&#8217;s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>\r\n<p>Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry&#8217;s worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>\r\n<p>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Why would a robot need to drink? But existing is basically all I do! Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</p>\r\n<p>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. We&#8217;re also Santa Claus! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y&#8217;all are in a 12-piece bucket o&#8217; trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin&#8217; up that ol&#8217; mess you caused.</p>\r\n<p>Now what? Kids don&#8217;t turn rotten just from watching TV. Yeah, lots of people did. I&#8217;m sure those windmills will keep them cool. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.</p>\r\n<p>I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Ask her how her day was. Who are those horrible orange men? It&#8217;s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>\r\n","excerpt":"<p>One hundred dollars.
