Your best is an idiot! It may comfort you to know that Fry&#8217;s death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</p>\r\n<p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. <strong>Goodbye, cruel world.</strong> <em>Goodbye, cruel lamp.</em> Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords.</p>\r\n<h2>And from now on you&#8217;re all named Bender Jr.</h2>\r\n<p>Good news, everyone! There&#8217;s a report on TV with some very bad news! Who am I making this out to? You know, I was God once. Hi, I&#8217;m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</li>\r\n<li>It may comfort you to know that Fry&#8217;s death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</li>\r\n<li>Bender, this is Fry&#8217;s decision… and he made it wrong. So it&#8217;s time for us to interfere in his life.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>When will that be?</h3>\r\n<p>Why did you bring us here? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y&#8217;all are in a 12-piece bucket o&#8217; trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin&#8217; up that ol&#8217; mess you caused. What&#8217;s with you kids? Every other day it&#8217;s food, food, food. Alright, I&#8217;ll get you some stupid food.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I meant &#8216;physically&#8217;. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</li>\r\n<li>Your best is an idiot!</li>\r\n<li>I found what I need. And it&#8217;s not friends, it&#8217;s things.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn&#8217;t make sense. But, okay! A true inspiration for the children. What are their names? I&#8217;m a thing. Kids don&#8217;t turn rotten just from watching TV.</p>\r\n<p>Fatal. I haven&#8217;t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. I wish! It&#8217;s a nickel.</p>\r\n<p>Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Leela, Bender, we&#8217;re going grave robbing.</p>\r\n<p>Are you crazy? I can&#8217;t swallow that. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! &#8216;It is!&#8217; My precious torso! I don&#8217;t want to be rescued.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. You won&#8217;t have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you&#8217;ll be doing. Actually, that&#8217;s still true. Fatal. Calculon is gonna kill us and it&#8217;s all everybody else&#8217;s fault!</p>\r\n<p>We&#8217;ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we&#8217;ll go home. Oh yeah, good luck with that. I&#8217;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p>\r\n<p>You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? I&#8217;m a thing. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! What are their names? Bender, you risked your life to save me!</p>\r\n<p>This opera&#8217;s as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can&#8217;t just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Kids don&#8217;t turn rotten just from watching TV.</p>\r\n<p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! That&#8217;s right, baby. I ain&#8217;t your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! You can crush me but you can&#8217;t crush my spirit! Yeah, lots of people did.</p>\r\n<p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Tell her she looks thin. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Ow, my spirit! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p>\r\n"}},"pageContext":{"id":2}}
